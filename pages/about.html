          <h4>Hi, I'm Lucia!</h4>
          <p>
            As an aspiring music therapist, Lucia's ambition is to bring awareness to the power of music in medicine. Her training has enabled her to gain clinical experience at various establishments such as Massachusetts General Hospital, McLean Hospital, and diverse programs through the Community Music Center of Boston. She has also volunteered at multiple non-profit organizations for youths in California, from music education to assisting those who are neurodiverse or with special needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up in the Bay Area, she began her passion for music early in school and later devoted much of her time towards her high school choir. This provided many opportunities for her to develop leadership skills and grow as a musician – from performing in several ensembles to directing/arranging for an acapella group, touring international venues including St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, as well as workshopping with San Francisco’s Chanticleer – earning her the Director’s Award for her dedication in musicianship and service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lucia is currently interning at Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC), completing her bachelor’s in music therapy with a minor in psychology at Berklee College of Music. Having also worked as a student assistant in institutional research and assessment at Berklee, she is looking forward to furthering her skills in music therapy towards a full time career with focuses on neuroscience and research.
