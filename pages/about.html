          <h4>Hi, I'm Lucia!</h4>
          <p>
            As an aspiring music therapist, Lucia's ambition is to bring awareness to the power of music in medicine. Growing up in the Bay Area, California, she began her passion for music early in school and later devoted much of her time towards her high school choir. This provided many opportunities for her to develop leadership skills and grow as a musician, earning her the Director’s Award for her dedication in musicianship and service. With a family background in medicine, she learned the importance of helping those in need and began volunteering at multiple non-profit organizations for youth music education and assisting those who are neurodivergent. Wanting to combine and share her interests has led her to a future in music therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lucia is currently completing her 1200-hour internship at Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) upon receiving her bachelor’s in music therapy with a minor in psychology from Berklee College of Music. Her training has also enabled her to gain clinical experience at multiple establishments such as Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), McLean Hospital, and various programs through the Community Music Center of Boston. From these collective experiences, she is looking forward to furthering her skills towards a full time career in music therapy with focuses on neuroscience and clinical research.
